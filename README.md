We investigate four machine learning models to find which model  best detects  intrusions in a wireless network.  We evaluate those models 
based on  accuracy, precision, recall and time of execution. After  evaluating these models, we conduct a feature analysis to see which features of the AWID dataset contribute most to those machine learning models while detecting intrusions.
